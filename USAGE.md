3. Copy and paste this command (right-click to paste in cmd):

```bash
cd Desktop
```

Press Enter. This moves to your Desktop.

4. Now paste this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruslanmv/BOT-MMORPG-AI.git
```

Press Enter and wait. You'll see text scrolling - that's normal!

## 🔧 Part 3: Installing The Bot

Now we'll install all the AI components.

### Step 1: Open Command Prompt in Bot Folder

1. Open the "BOT-MMORPG-AI" folder on your Desktop
2. Hold `Shift` and right-click in the empty space
3. Click "Open PowerShell window here" or "Open command window here"

### Step 2: Install UV Package Manager

Paste this command:

## 🎓 Part 5: Teaching The AI (Data Collection)

Now the fun part - teaching the AI how YOU play!

### Step 1: Start Recording

In your command prompt (in the BOT-MMORPG-AI folder), type:

```bash
make collect-data
```

Or if that doesn't work:

```bash
python versions/0.01/1-collect_data.py
```

### Step 2: Play Normally

1. **You'll see a countdown**: 4... 3... 2... 1...
2. **Switch to your game window**
3. **Play normally for 10-15 minutes**:
   - Walk around your farming route
   - Fight some enemies
   - Collect items
   - Jump, run, use skills

**The bot is watching and learning from you!** 👀

### Step 3: Recording Controls

While recording:
- Press `T` to **pause/resume** (if you need a break)
- Press `Q` to **stop and save** (when done)

### Step 4: What To Record

**Good recordings include:**
- Walking your farming route 2-3 times
- Fighting the same enemies repeatedly
- Collecting items
- Normal gameplay patterns

**Avoid:**
- Opening menus
- Checking inventory
- Cutscenes
- AFK time

### Step 5: Check Your Data

After recording, you should see files like:
- `preprocessed_training_data-1.npy`
- `preprocessed_training_data-2.npy`
- etc.

**More files = Better training!** Aim for at least 5-10 files (about 15 minutes of gameplay).

💡 **Pro Tip**: You can run this multiple times to collect more data!

✅ **Success!** You've taught the AI!

---

## 🧠 Part 6: Training The AI (The Magic Happens)

Now we'll train the AI on your gameplay.

### Step 1: Start Training

In your command prompt, type:

```bash
make train-model
```

Or:

```bash
python versions/0.01/2-train_model.py
```

### Step 2: Wait For Training

You'll see text scrolling with numbers and progress. This is NORMAL!

**Training Time:**
- With NVIDIA GPU: 30-60 minutes ⚡
- Without GPU: 2-4 hours 🐌

**What's happening:**
- The AI is studying your gameplay
- It's learning which buttons to press
- It's building a "brain" (neural network)

### Step 3: You'll Know It's Done When...

You see messages like:
- `SAVING MODEL!`
- Training completes without errors
- You're back at the command prompt

**Don't close the window!** Let it finish completely.

✅ **Success!** Your AI is trained!

### Step 1: Position Your Character

1. **Open your game**
2. **Go to the bridge of Mondstadt** (same starting position)
3. **Set time to 12:00**
4. **Make sure controller is connected** (if you used one)

### Step 2: Start The Bot

In command prompt:

```bash
make test-model
```

Or:

```bash
python versions/0.01/3-test_model.py
```

### Step 3: Watch The Magic

1. **You'll see a countdown**: 4... 3... 2... 1...
2. **Switch to your game window**
3. **Take your hands OFF the controls!** 🙌
4. **Watch the AI play!**

![Bot Playing](./assets/images/posts/README/bot.gif)

### Step 4: Bot Controls

While the bot is running:
- Press `T` to **pause/resume** the AI
- Press `ESC` to **stop** the bot completely

### Step 5: Troubleshooting

**Bot is stuck?**
- It will auto-escape after a few seconds
- Or press `T` to pause, reposition manually, press `T` again

**Bot not moving?**
- Make sure you're at the starting position
- Make sure time is set to 12:00
- Try recording more training data

**Bot doing weird things?**
- Normal at first! It learns from mistakes
- Record more training data
- Try training again

## 🎯 Part 8: Advanced Tips

### Making Your Bot Better

**1. More Training Data = Smarter Bot**
- Record 30+ minutes of gameplay
- Play the same route multiple times
- Be consistent with your actions

**2. Retrain Periodically**
- If bot behaves badly, collect more data
- Retrain with: `make train-model`
- Each training session improves the AI

**3. Multiple Routes**
- You can train different bots for different routes
- Rename your model files to keep them separate
- Example: `model/mondstadt`, `model/liyue`

### Running 24/7

**Safety First:**
- Don't leave completely unattended
- Check every few hours
- Respect the game's ToS (Terms of Service)

**Power Settings:**
- Set PC to never sleep
- Disable screen timeout
- Keep game in fullscreen

**Performance:**
- Close other programs
- Use a wired controller (more stable)
- Lower graphics settings if needed

## 📱 Diablo Immortal (Android/Emulator) Setup

Diablo Immortal runs on Android and can also be played through an emulator. This project includes an ADB-driven runner that can capture the device screen and replay actions based on the model output.

### Step 1: Install Android Platform Tools

1. Download **Android Platform Tools**: [https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)
2. Unzip the tools and add the folder to your PATH (or set `ADB_PATH`).
3. Verify ADB works:

```bash
adb devices
```

You should see your emulator/device listed.

### Step 2: Configure the On-Screen Controls

Open `configs/diablo_immortal_android.json` and update the coordinates for your emulator layout:

- `movement.center`: the virtual joystick center
- `tap_actions`: ability buttons and skills
- `key_events`: optional Android key events (like back)

### Step 3: Run the Bot on Android/Emulator

Once you have a trained model for Diablo Immortal gameplay, run:

```bash
python -m bot_mmorpg.scripts.test_model_android \
  --model artifacts/model/mmorpg_bot \
  --profile configs/diablo_immortal_android.json
```

**Tip:** If you have more than one device connected, pass `--device <serial>`.

## ⚔️ Elden Ring: Nightreign (PC) Setup

The profiled runner supports PC titles with custom keybindings. Use the Nightreign profile as a starting point.

### Step 1: Verify Keybinds

Open `configs/elden_ring_nightreign_pc.json` and align `press_actions` with your in-game keybinds.

### Step 2: Run the Profiled Bot

```bash
python -m bot_mmorpg.scripts.test_model_profile \
  --model artifacts/model/mmorpg_bot \
  --profile configs/elden_ring_nightreign_pc.json
```
