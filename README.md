## 🎯 What Is This?

**Tired of grinding for hours?** Let AI do it for you!

**BOT-MMORPG-AI** is your personal gaming assistant that uses artificial intelligence to play your favorite MMORPG and RPG games automatically. It watches how YOU play, learns from your gameplay, and then takes over the boring, repetitive tasks while you relax, work, or sleep.

### 🎮 Perfect For

## 🎯 How To Use - Visual Guide

### 📍 Step 1: Position Your Character

![Starting Position](./assets/images/posts/README/step-0.png)

**Stand at the bridge of Mondstadt** - this is your starting point!

### ⏰ Step 2: Set Game Time

![Set Time](./assets/images/posts/README/step-2.png)

**Set in-game time to 12:00** for consistent lighting and better AI performance

### 🎮 Step 3: Verify Controller (Optional)

![Controller Check](./assets/images/posts/README/step-1.png)

**If using a gamepad**, make sure it's connected and recognized

### 🎬 Step 4: Record Your Gameplay

```bash
make collect-data
```

- Play normally for 10-15 minutes
- The AI watches and learns from you
- Press `T` to pause/resume recording
- Press `Q` to stop and save

**💡 Pro Tip**: Play the same route 2-3 times for better results!

### 🧠 Step 5: Train The AI

```bash
make train-model
```

This trains the neural network on your gameplay. Time depends on your hardware:
- **With GPU**: 30-60 minutes
- **Without GPU**: 2-4 hours

☕ Perfect time for a coffee break!

### 🚀 Step 6: Let It Play!

```bash
make test-model
```

1. Position your character at the bridge
2. Set time to 12:00
3. Run the command
4. Switch to game window
5. Watch the magic happen! ✨

**Controls while bot is playing:**
- `T`: Pause/resume the AI
- `ESC`: Stop the bot completely

## 🎮 Interactive Launcher

![](assets/2025-12-26-22-05-39.png)

The **BOT-MMORPG-AI Launcher** is a gaming-style dashboard that lets you manage the entire AI lifecycle without touching the command line. Built with `Eel`, it acts as a central control panel where you can collect data, train your models, and run the bot with a single click.

It features real-time terminal feedback, automatic API key loading, and process management to start or stop tasks instantly.

### 1. Installation

First, install the launcher dependencies (specifically `Eel` and `Chromium` wrappers):

```bash
make install-launcher

```

### 2. Configuration

Ensure you have your API keys set up. Create a `.env` file in the project root (see `.env.example`) and add your Google Gemini API key:

```ini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

```
![](assets/2025-12-26-22-12-56.png)
### 3. How to Run

Launch the dashboard using the following command:

```bash
uv run python launcher/launcher.py

```

### 4. Dashboard Features

* **🔴 Start Recording:** Runs `1-collect_data.py` to capture screen data and user inputs for the dataset.
* **🧠 Train Model:** Runs `2-train_model.py` to process the data and train the deep learning model. You will see real-time training logs in the launcher terminal.
* **▶️ Start Bot:** Runs `3-test_model.py` to activate the AI agent and let it play the game autonomously.

### Neural Network Architectures

The project supports multiple neural network architectures:

| Model | Size | Top-1 Acc | Top-5 Acc | Parameters | Inference (GPU) |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| InceptionV3 | 92 MB | 77.9% | 93.7% | 23.9M | 6.9 ms |
| ResNet50 | 98 MB | 74.9% | 92.1% | 25.6M | 4.6 ms |
| ResNet101 | 171 MB | 76.4% | 92.8% | 44.7M | 5.2 ms |
| VGG16 | 528 MB | 71.3% | 90.1% | 138.4M | 4.2 ms |
| MobileNetV2 | 14 MB | 71.3% | 90.1% | 3.5M | 3.8 ms |

---

## Performance Optimization

### Motion Detection

The bot uses motion detection to prevent getting stuck:
```python
motion_req = 800  # Minimum motion threshold
log_len = 25      # Motion history length
```

When stuck, the bot executes random evasive maneuvers.

### Prediction Weighting

Custom weights applied to predictions for game-specific behavior:
```python
weights = [4.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 1.8, 1.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.2, ...]
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Model not loading
- **Solution**: Ensure model files are in `model/` directory

**Issue**: Screen capture not working
- **Solution**: Run game in fullscreen 1920x1080 resolution

**Issue**: Bot getting stuck
- **Solution**: Adjust `motion_req` threshold in test script

**Issue**: Low FPS during recording
- **Solution**: Lower capture resolution or use faster storage

**Issue**: CUDA out of memory
- **Solution**: Reduce batch size in training configuration
